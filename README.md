# -Linux-RGB-Keyboard-Driver-on-Gigabyte-G5-Laptop
Linux on Gigabyte Laptops has few drivers that support LED activation for keyboard. And if there is support, their GUI driver has been removed from the repositories. So I created a "program" based on "Tuxedo-keyboard" to communicate with the keyboard and you can control the LED using Terminal and shortcut keys.
